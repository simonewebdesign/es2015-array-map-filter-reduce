# JavaScript (ES6/ES2015) recursive reduce array

Just an experiment on how to recursively reduce an array of nested items.

Assuming you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine, clone this repo and then run `make`. 

You should see this:

```
> make
make test
node_modules/.bin/mocha main.js


  âœ“ should be green

  1 passing (8ms)
